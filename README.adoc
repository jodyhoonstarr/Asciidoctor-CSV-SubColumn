To include content by column range, begin with start column end with end column and separate them with two dot (e.g., columns=1..5) to the columns attribute.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns=1..3, column_separator=","]
```
You could have multiple ranges separate with comma. Quote the list of ranges as commas are normally to separate individual attributes.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns="1..3,10..14", column_separator=","]
```

You can use semi-colons to separate ranges to instead the quote and commas combination.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns=1;5..8;10..15, column_separator=","]
```
column_separator in attribute need defined according filename.csv. if column separator is ";", change the value column_separator=";"

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns=1;5..8;10..15, column_separator=";"]
```

Lines can also be extracted, along with columns.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[lines=1;5, columns=1;5..8;10..15, column_separator=","]
```


Or just lines, in the asciidoctor standard csv processor.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[lines=1;5]
```

== Example
* Original csv file

```asciidoc
[%autowidth%header, format=csv, separator=,]
|===
\include::{includedir}\FieldAgents.csv[]
|===
```

* New csv file with choose sub column
```asciidoc
[%autowidth%header, format=csv, separator=,]
|===
\include::{includedir}\FieldAgents.csv[columns="1,4,5", column_separator=","]
|===
```

OR

```asciidoc
[%autowidth%header, format=csv, separator=,]
|===
\include::{includedir}\FieldAgents.csv[columns=1;4;5, column_separator=","]
|===
```

== Using extension
link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab[Reference asciidoctor-extensions-lab]

First, make sure Asciidoctor is installed:

 $ gem install asciidoctor

Next, run the extension from the root directory of the project:

  $ asciidoctor -r ./lib/csvsubcolumn-include-processor.rb ./sample.adoc

The output file, [path]_sample.html_, was created in the same directory as the source file, [path]_sample.adoc_.

The relevant bits of the input and output are shown below.

._./sample.adoc_
link:sample.adoc[sample.adoc]

._./sample.html_
link:sample.html[sample.html]

== TODO (Unfinished task)
. Is zero-based csv file columns or not (the first column in csv file is 0 or 1?). None zero-based could be better. Need further discuss.

. Column range: Refer to the last column of the document using the value -1.

```asciidoc
\include::filename.csv[columns=3..-1]
```

. check edge case (file is empty, et al). Show fridendly information to user.

. Use table attribute key "separator" [%autowidth%header, format=csv, separator=,] to replace include attribute key "column_separator".
